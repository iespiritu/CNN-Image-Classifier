# CNN-Image-Classifier
Convolutional Neural Network Image Classifier for Applied Machine Learning class.

Created convolutional neural network image classifiers. Ran tests on MNIST dataset, CIFAR10 dataset using ResNet18 and Stanford Cars dataset using ResNet152.

Applied transfer learning on ResNet18 and ResNet152.

Phase 1 is my initial learning and testing part of the lab working with neural network layer instantiation and fine tuning hyperparameters.
Phase 2 is partially complete and is missing classification report on different animal labels. Transfer learning applied on CIFAR10 dataset using ResNet18 model.
Phase 3 is completed on Vehicle Classification using transfer learning on ResNet152 model with Stanford Cars dataset.
